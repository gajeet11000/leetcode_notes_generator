# AI Prefill

This is the part of the project that writes a **first draft** of your study notes
(core idea, invariant, trap, recognition clue, complexity...) by asking an AI to read
the problem + your accepted solution and fill those sections in for you. You still
review and rewrite it — it's a starting point, not the final note. The algorithmic
pattern (frontmatter tags, not a prose section) and your final takeaway are never
AI-generated — the takeaway in particular is meant to be your own words.

It does **not** need an API key or any paid API access. By default it runs
[Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) itself in headless mode (`claude -p`),
so it uses whatever subscription you already use `claude` with in your terminal.

If you'd rather use a different tool (Ollama, a local model, some other CLI AI tool),
you can — see [Using a different AI tool](#using-a-different-ai-tool-no-code-needed)
below. That's the main point of this doc.

## How it works, in plain terms

There are two separate steps. They are separate on purpose — generating is slow and
you don't want to accidentally redo it every time you render a note.

**Step 1 — Generate.**

```bash
uv run python cli.py notes prefill two-sum
```

This reads the stored problem description + your accepted solution for `two-sum`,
sends them to the AI with instructions to answer in a specific JSON shape, checks the
answer actually matches that shape, and saves it.

Where it's saved: `LEETCODE_DATA/dsa_problems/ai_prefill.json`, one entry per problem
slug. Every time you generate again for the same slug, it's added as a **new version**
— nothing is ever deleted or overwritten. Handy if you want to try again after
tweaking a prompt, or just compare a couple of attempts.

**Step 2 — Render.**

```bash
uv run python cli.py notes render two-sum --style plain --ai
```

This writes the actual note file, using the **latest** saved version from step 1 to
fill in the draft sections. If you haven't generated anything yet for that slug,
`notes render --ai` generates one for you automatically before rendering — you don't
have to run `notes prefill` first. Pass `--regenerate-ai` instead of `--ai` to always
generate a fresh version first, even if one already exists.

If you don't pass `--ai` at all (just `--style plain` or `--style obsidian`, the
default), those sections are left blank for you to fill in by hand, exactly like
before this feature existed. AI prefill is opt-in.

### Batch versions

Both commands support `--all` to run over every problem you've already fetched
(`notes render` also supports `--recent`/`--today` to scope to what LeetCode says you
solved recently — see its `--help`):

```bash
uv run python cli.py notes prefill --all
uv run python cli.py notes render --all --style obsidian --ai
```

Useful flags for `notes prefill --all`:

| Flag | What it does |
|---|---|
| `--regenerate` | Generate a new version even for slugs that already have one. |
| `--no-rate-limit` | Skip the small pause between calls (see below). Fine if you're not on a rate-limited plan. |
| `--limit N` | Only process the first N pending slugs. |
| `--max-failures N` | Stop the batch after N calls in a row fail (default 5, catches something being broken early instead of grinding through hundreds of failures). |

---

## Where everything lives

| What | Where |
|---|---|
| Generated content (the actual data) | `LEETCODE_DATA/dsa_problems/ai_prefill.json` |
| The two prompts sent to the AI | `resources/prompts/ai_prefill/system_prompt.txt` and `resources/prompts/ai_prefill/user_prompt.txt` — plain text files, edit them directly to change the instructions or wording |
| The JSON shape the AI must answer in | `modules/ai_prefill/schema.py` (`PrefillContent`) |
| Settings (which AI tool, timeouts, etc.) | `.env` — see `.env.example`, everything is prefixed `AI_PREFILL_` |
| The code | `modules/ai_prefill/` |

The prompt files use `$placeholder` style variables (e.g. `$title`, `$description`,
`$code`) — you can reword everything around them freely, just keep the placeholders
that are already there.

---

## Using a different AI tool (no code needed)

By default, `.env` has:

```bash
AI_PREFILL_PROVIDER=claude_code
AI_PREFILL_MODEL=sonnet
```

To use **any other command-line AI tool** instead — Ollama, `llm`, a custom script,
anything you can run from a terminal — switch the provider to `command` and tell it
how to run your tool:

```bash
AI_PREFILL_PROVIDER=command
AI_PREFILL_COMMAND=ollama run llama3
```

That's it. No Python code to write. Here's what's actually happening: whatever you
put in `AI_PREFILL_COMMAND` gets run as a program, the prompt is sent to it on stdin,
and whatever it prints back is read as the answer.

Two more settings you may need, depending on the tool:

```bash
# Only set this if your tool has a dedicated flag for a "system prompt"
# (instructions) separate from the actual question. If you don't set it,
# the instructions are just added to the front of the same text sent on
# stdin, which works fine for most tools.
AI_PREFILL_SYSTEM_PROMPT_FLAG=

# Only set this if your tool wraps its answer inside a bigger JSON object,
# e.g. {"response": "...the actual answer..."} — put the key name here
# ("response" in that example) so it can be unwrapped. Leave empty if your
# tool just prints the answer directly.
AI_PREFILL_ENVELOPE_KEY=
```

The only real requirement for any tool you plug in this way: when asked, it must be
able to answer with **just the JSON object** described in
`resources/prompts/ai_prefill/system_prompt.txt` — no extra commentary. Most
instructable models can do this if you tell them to (the default prompt already does).

### If your tool needs something more custom

The `command` provider covers "run a program, send text on stdin, read text back."
If your tool needs something that doesn't fit that (its own login step, a weird
non-JSON wrapper, whatever), you can write a small adapter instead. Every provider is
just one class with one method:

```python
# modules/ai_prefill/providers/base.py
class AIProvider(ABC):
    name: str

    @abstractmethod
    def generate(self, *, system_prompt: str, user_prompt: str) -> str:
        """Run the tool, return its raw text answer."""
```

Look at `modules/ai_prefill/providers/claude_code.py` for a real, small example (it's
about 40 lines). Once you've written your class, register it by name in
`modules/ai_prefill/providers/registry.py`, then point `AI_PREFILL_PROVIDER` at that
name in `.env`.

---

## Rate limiting

`AI_PREFILL_RATE_LIMIT_SECONDS` (default `3`) is how long `notes prefill --all` pauses
between each generation. This exists for accounts on a plan with tighter usage limits.
If you're on a plan without that concern, pass `--no-rate-limit` on the command, or
just set `AI_PREFILL_RATE_LIMIT_SECONDS=0` in `.env` to make it the default.

---

## A note on cost/performance (default provider)

Since each `notes prefill` call runs `claude -p` as a fresh subprocess with no shared
session, it's worth knowing whether that defeats prompt caching — it doesn't.
Anthropic's cache is keyed by content hash at the API layer, not by client session, so
the (fully static) system prompt gets served from cache automatically across repeated
calls once it's been created once, with no code needed on our end to make that happen.
In practice, per-call cost/usage is dominated by input tokens (the problem description
+ your solution code, each capped at `AI_PREFILL_MAX_DESCRIPTION_CHARS`/
`AI_PREFILL_MAX_CODE_CHARS`), not by the small JSON object the model outputs.

---

## A note on the default (Claude Code) provider specifically

Since the default provider runs `claude` itself as a subprocess, it's worth knowing
what it can and can't see or do, in case that matters to you:

- It runs with `--safe-mode`, which turns off this project's (and your global)
  `CLAUDE.md`, skills, plugins, hooks, and any configured MCP servers for that one
  call — it only ever sees the problem text and solution code you're asking about,
  nothing else from your setup.
- Its built-in tools (reading/writing files, running shell commands, browsing the
  web, etc.) are explicitly turned off — it can only answer in text, it can't take
  any actions.
- It runs from a temp folder rather than this project's folder, as an extra layer of
  the same protection.
- Auth still works normally — it uses the same login as your regular `claude`
  terminal sessions, so nothing extra to set up.

None of this applies if you switch to a different tool via `AI_PREFILL_PROVIDER=command`
— what that tool can see/do is entirely up to however you configured it yourself.
