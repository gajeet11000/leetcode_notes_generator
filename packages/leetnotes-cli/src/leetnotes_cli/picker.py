"""Shared interactive fuzzy picker for commands that accept `SLUG | --all`.

Typing (or copy-pasting) a LeetCode slug by hand is painful — they're long
and there's no way to search LeetCode's own site for one. Whenever a command
gets neither a SLUG nor --all, it falls back to this instead of erroring:
a searchable, multi-select prompt over whatever's known about each problem,
so you never have to type a slug at all.

    Prefers a local DB record (`known`) when one exists; otherwise falls back

    the bare slug — still searchable on its own, since LeetCode slugs are
