"""Command-line interface entrypoint for the LeetCode notes generator.

Thin wrapper around `LeetCodeSyncManager` (fetch/store) and
`LeetCodeDSAProblemMarkdownRender` (render). All commands are safe to re-run:
each `problems data fetch` step only does network work when the target data
is missing or `--refetch` is passed.

Command implementations live in `modules/cli/`, split by area: problems
(data fetch + pending cache, db, render, recent), notes (the everyday fetch
-> render pipeline, plus standalone AI prefill generation).
